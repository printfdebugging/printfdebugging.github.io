Hi! I am Sahil Gautam an  active [libreoffice contributor](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/q/sahil) and C++ enthuziast. For
a long time, I  was caught in this delima of  choosing my domain in computer science.  Computer graphics, language design,
distributed computing,  systems engineering, it's very  hard to let go  of any one of  these but to make  some significant
progress with my projects I had to choose one. I decided to go with computer graphics for the next decadeâ€¦

Other delima that I had to overcome was "VIM v/s EMACS" which  one should I use. I choose neovim. I liked emacs for around
an year or so but now I question it's existance. VIM when paired with other tools will always be leagues ahead of emacs. I
like the concept, but I just couldn't use it for anything professional.
